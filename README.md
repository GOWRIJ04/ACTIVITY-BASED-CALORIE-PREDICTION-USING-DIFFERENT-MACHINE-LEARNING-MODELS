# ACTIVITY-BASED-CALORIE-PREDICTION-USING-DIFFERENT-MACHINE-LEARNING-MODELS
This project predicts calorie burn from fitness data using machine learning. Linear Regression proved most accurate among the models tested, outperforming SVM, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest. This work offers valuable insights for personalized health and fitness tracking.

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze and predict calorie burn based 
on activity data, including steps, active minutes, and distances. The dataset contains activity metrics such
as steps taken, various intensity activity minutes, distances, and corresponding calories burned. The 
primary objectives were to build predictive models, and by using the best model to predict activity-based 
calorie and to visualize performance trends.
First, data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis were conducted to identify patterns and 
relationships within the dataset. Multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Support Vector 
Regression (SVM), Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, were implemented to 
predict calorie burn. The models were evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean 
Squared Error (MSE), and R2. The results showed that Linear Regression outperformed the other models 
in terms of accuracy, with the lowest MAE and highest R2 value, while SVM showed weaker 
performance.
Visualization techniques such as scatter plots, and bar graphs were employed to analyze trends and
evaluate model performance. These visualizations revealed key insights, such as periods of high or low 
activity and the effectiveness of different predictive models.
The project concludes by demonstrating the potential of machine learning for activity-based calorie 
prediction and highlights areas for improvement, such as incorporating additional features or more 
advanced ensemble methods to enhance prediction accuracy. This work provides valu- able insights into 
the relationship between physical activity and calorie burn, with applications in personalized fitness 
tracking and health management systems.
